# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

OVERVIEW:
In this project, users are able to add fitness goals but they're pevented from adding duplicate fitness goals. The goals that are added can be deleted/erased just by clicking them. 

Debugging task:
In this case, when a user tries to add a fitness goal that already exists, an alert that informs the user of the existing goal appears.

Challenges:
Enabling the removal of the fitness goal when it is clicked was a last minute addition to the project, but it was not difficult.

Feedback:
Overall, I enjoyed this challenge. It makes me want to learn more and do more research to find different solutions to this problem. It was a bit challenging in the beginning but I managed with the help of resources such as Youtube, W3Schools and freecodecamp.
